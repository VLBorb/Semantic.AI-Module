## Capabilities and Application Potential

This module provides advanced semantic and grammatical control over large language model (LLM) text generation, combining deep learning with structured linguistic validation. It is designed to ensure high-quality, context-aware, and ethically constrained natural language output. Below are the core capabilities and potential applications of the Semantic.AI-Module:

### Core Capabilities

- **Semantic Encoding & Validation:**  
  Converts natural language into structured 12-digit semantic codes that encode linguistic features such as part of speech, polarity, register, semantic domain, and more. These codes are validated using grammatical and semantic rules to ensure syntactic and semantic coherence in generated sequences.

- **Controlled Text Generation:**  
  Fine-tunes and constrains LLMs (e.g., Llama 2, GPT-2) to produce text that adheres to specified semantic codes and validation criteria, enabling output with targeted stylistic and semantic properties.

- **Cognitive Reasoning Modules:**  
  Includes deductive reasoning and belief modules that simulate logical inference and belief updating, paving the way for explainable AI text generation.

- **Ethical Governance:**  
  Implements an ethical constitution layer that checks generated content against explicit rules, preventing the output of harmful or inappropriate text.

- **Contextual Memory:**  
  Uses a SQLite database to store and retrieve interaction history, allowing the system to maintain conversational context and improve coherence over time.

- **Traceability and Logging:**  
  Comprehensive logging of all operations, including input processing, code generation, validation outcomes, and ethical evaluations, supporting transparency and auditability.

### Application Potential

- **Conversational AI & Chatbots:**  
  Enables the development of assistants that maintain context, produce coherent and relevant responses, and follow ethical guidelines in sensitive domains such as healthcare, education, or customer support.

- **Automated Content Generation:**  
  Generates high-quality, style-controlled, and semantically coherent text for applications in journalism, report writing, marketing, and more.

- **Language Education:**  
  Provides advanced feedback and correction for language learners by validating grammar, style, and semantic appropriateness in real time.

- **Professional and Legal Writing:**  
  Assures compliance with domain-specific terminology and style, supports document drafting in legal, medical, or technical fields, and validates consistency.

- **Research and Explainable AI:**  
  Serves as a testbed for studying cognitive processes in language models, benchmarking LLMs, and developing explainable and auditable AI systems.

- **Content Moderation and Filtering:**  
  Automatically screens generated or user-submitted content for harmful or inappropriate language, supporting safe and inclusive platforms.

This project provides a semantic and grammatical layer around GPT-2. It supports two execution modes:

- **TRAIN** – prepare vocabulary files from text corpora and fine‑tune GPT‑2
- **INFERENCE** – load the trained model and interact with it through a conversation loop

## Setup

Install dependencies and spaCy language model:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage

Run in inference mode (default):

```bash
python semantic_ai.py --mode INFERENCE
```

To prepare data and fine‑tune the model:

```bash
python semantic_ai.py --mode TRAIN
```

The base directory for data and models can be changed with the `SEMANTIC_AI_BASE_DIR` environment variable.

# Semantic AI with Llama 2: A Cognitive Architecture

This project implements a novel semantic artificial intelligence (AI) system that combines the power of large language models (LLMs), specifically Llama 2, with a structured semantic representation. The goal is to create an AI capable of more controlled, coherent, and explainable text processing and generation.

## Core Features

* **Semantic Encoding:**
    * Transforms natural language words into 12-digit numeric codes.
    * These codes capture linguistic features: Part of Speech (POS), subcategory, polarity, abstractness, semantic domain, register, rhyme, and a local identifier.

* **Semantic Validation:**
    * Analyzes sequences of semantic codes using predefined grammatical and semantic rules.
    * Ensures the validity of word sequences based on POS succession, polarity consistency, register consistency, etc.

* **Controlled Text Generation:**
    * Fine-tunes the Llama 2 model to generate text that adheres to the semantic codes and validation rules.
    * Enables the generation of text with specific stylistic and semantic properties.

* **Epistemic Reasoning:**
    * Includes a basic deductive cognition engine to perform simple logical inferences.
    * Incorporates a belief module to simulate the formation and updating of beliefs based on context.

* **Ethical Constraints:**
    * Implements an ethical constitution that validates generated text against predefined rules to prevent harmful or inappropriate content.

* **Contextual Memory:**
    * Utilizes a SQLite database to store and retrieve contextual information, enabling the system to maintain a history of interactions.

* **Traceability and Logging:**
    * Provides comprehensive logging of system operations, including input processing, code generation, validation results, and ethical evaluations.

## Architecture

The system is designed with a modular architecture:

1. **Vocabulary Management:**
    * Loads and manages the mapping between words and semantic codes.
    * Includes functionality to generate and save the semantic vocabulary.

2. **Semantic Processing:**
    * Encodes text into semantic code sequences.
    * Validates code sequences based on grammatical and semantic rules.
    * Calculates a semantic score to evaluate the coherence of code sequences.

3. **Language Generation:**
    * Fine-tunes a Llama 2 model on text data augmented with semantic codes.
    * Generates text from sequences of semantic codes.

4. **Cognitive Modules:**
    * Deductive Cognition Engine: Performs basic logical inferences.
    * Belief Module: Simulates belief formation and updating.

5. **Ethical Governance:**
    * Ethical Constitution: Enforces ethical guidelines on generated text.

6. **Contextual Awareness:**
    * Contextual Memory: Stores and retrieves past interactions.

7. **Evaluation:**
    * Evaluation Metrics: Calculates various metrics to assess the quality of generated text (BLEU, ROUGE, lexical diversity, logical consistency, semantic score).

## Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Large Language Model:** Llama 2
* **NLP Libraries:** spaCy, NLTK, phonetics
* **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
* **Transformers Library:** Hugging Face Transformers

## Execution Modes

The system supports two execution modes:

* **TRAIN:**
    * Used for initial data preparation and model fine-tuning.
    * Downloads and processes the corpus, generates the semantic vocabulary, and fine-tunes the Llama 2 model.

* **INFERENCE:**
    * Used for running the semantic conversation system.
    * Loads the pre-trained model, vocabularies, and matrices, and enables interactive conversation.
